# What Defines Gender in Perfumes?
The relationship between perfume ingredients, scent notes affect gender classification. The goal is to identify which combinations of brand, scent notes, ingredients and concentration most strongly influence whether a perfume is marketed as masculine, feminine, or unisex. They will be visualized into clusters to show how each cluster has its unique characteristics, based on the values in their features.

### Introduction 
We can start by identifying the most influential element of each that are associated with gender classification. Then moving on, we build a classification model to predict gender category (male, female, unisex) based on these features. Finally, the results can be visualized in clusters in a dimensionally reduced "scent space" to explore how they cluster according to gender. Within these clusters, we go further and examine overlaps and divergence(outliers) in gendered perfume marketing to highlight trends and biases.
